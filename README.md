# Docker


Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create , deploy and run application by using containers. Containers allow a developer to pakage up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies and deploy it as one pakage. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customize settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code



# AWS EC2 Instance


An Amazon EC2 instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. AWS is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform; EC2 is a service that enables business subscribers to run application programs in the computing environment. It can serve as a practically unlimited set of virtual machines (VMs).


Amazon provides various types of instances with different configurations of CPU, memory, storage and networking resources to suit user needs. Each type is available in various sizes to address specific workload requirements.



# Apache

Apache is a web server software that is responsible for accepting HTTP requests from visitors and sending them back the requested information in the form of web pages.
Another way to look at it is that Apache is responsible for ensuring that the server your website is stored on can communicate with the device a visitor is using. Itâ€™s what connects the visitor hardware to your own.
